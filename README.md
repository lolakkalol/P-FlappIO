# P-FlappIO
This is a recreation of an older project of mine called "FlappIO" that was written in processing.
The aim of this project is to simply make a cleaner and "better" version of my old program since i think i can do better.

The program is going to work through a from scratch coded neuroevolution algorithm.

This program uses 2 libraries: pygame and random.
